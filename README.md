# Scrape and Score

## Overview 
The aim of this project is to detect when quarterback passing yard projections on prop bet markets are overfit to recent game data. Bayesian analysis is used to determine whether recent game data justifies projections significantly lower, or higher than a quarterback's career average, or if public sentiment has led to innacurately priced lines.
